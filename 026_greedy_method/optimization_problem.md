# Optimization Problem

- Optimization solution, is a solution that solve a problem with the best solution possible.
- We've one problem (p), and few solutions to this problem (s1, s2, s3, ..., sK).
- But we also have some constraint and objective.

- Let's say that I want to buy a new phone.
  - I only can pay 3k -> Constraint
  - I want the phone with the maximum storage -> Objective

- I have 3 phones with different prices and storage. I'll pick just the one that have the maximum storage and cost less
than 3K.
